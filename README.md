# CLI Apps :rocket:

This repo contains some command line interfaces built to enhance my skills regarding the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language

## Features :muscle:

- :four_leaf_clover: gofortune: simulates the Fortune command line interface which displays a random phrase and its author.
- :cat2: gololcat: based on [Lolcat]. Makes input text colorful
- :cow: gocowsay: simulates [cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay). And it has a stegosaurus too
